Hey, I'm Dylan. I'm a full stack software developer, just graduated from Codeworks, and I'm pretty into [whatever they're talking about]. I've kind of been bouncing around for a while---traveling, and so on---but honestly I just find software development so fascinating that I think I've landed here pretty solidly. I'm really hoping to learn more about the frameworks and languages I know and to see what's possible with the ones I don't, and honestly in learning more about new technologies in general, like VR and machine learning. I wouldn't mind getting into math and data science too; I love that blog FiveThirtyEight. Anyways, I think I'd do pretty well here considering you guys are doing such exciting stuff and that that's basically what I'm all about.
