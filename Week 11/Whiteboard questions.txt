At the two whiteboard challenges I attended, I noticed that I did better when I gave myself a solid moment to think. The format is meant to encourage you to think out load, but I have twice come to reflect that it would probably be better to take just a moment or two of silence to break the problem apart in my mind. I also noticed I had more success when I did what Mark suggests, which is to think about exactly what you expect to return and what you are inputting, and then from there to break up the steps to achieve that return.

I'm hoping to get an opportunity to practice some more of them before my career week, but I also intend to come in tomorrow (6/1) to watch the juniors and see how they do.
Also I should probably get some sleep before.
