Hey there _x_!

I know it's been a while, but I thought you might like to know that I can make stuff now. Well, apps. I can make apps. And since I was a cook I can make apps and apps, so needless to say I've got a lot of skills now.


Hi there,

I'm a new grad out of an excellent Software Development school, and now I'm a Fullstack Developer with more experience than I would have thought possible.
